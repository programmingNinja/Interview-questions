The Mingo game: 
The game of Mingo involves a 100 X 100 board with unique positive whole numbers 
in the range from 1 to 1,000,000 randomly distributed in the cells. Unique numbers are 
"called" one at a time and the goal is to have a "Mingo", which is an entire row or 
column of cells with numbers that have been called; one might also form a diagonal from 
corner to corner with numbers that have been called. Write a function that takes as 
parameters a square array of 100 X 100 positive whole numbers and list of "called" numbers. 
Your function will report whether a "Mingo" occurs, and after how many called numbers the 
first Mingo occurs. You may assume valid input.
